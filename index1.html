          <h1>Saar Fridman</h1>
          <h2> Intro</h2>

          <p>Saar is an Engineering student at TU Berlin with 7+ years of work experience in Management and Operations in his home country Israel. He is an ambitious, fast learner who constantly acquires new skills in his fields of interest, including Data Science, Programming, and Agile methodologies.
          Saar is also a passionate triathlete who competes at a national level and currently trains for the Half Ironman.

          Contact Saar with opportunities in Project Management, Scrum, and Operations in a Tech-driven environment. .</p>

          <p>The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Intuition is fucking important. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to.
